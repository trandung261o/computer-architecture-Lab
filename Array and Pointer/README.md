##### assign.1
    Consider a list of integers of length n. A prefix of length I for the given list 
    consist of the first i integers in the list, where 0 <= i <=n. A maximum-sum 
    prefix, as the name implies, is a prefix for which the sum of elements is the 
    largest among all prefixes. For example, if the list is (2,-3,2,5,-4), its 
    maximum-sum prefix consists of the first four elements and the associated sum is
    3+2+5=6; no other prefix of the given list has a larger sum
##### assign.2
    A given list of n numbers can be sorted in ascending order as follows. Find a 
    largest number in the list (there may be more than one) and swap it with the last 
    element in the list. The new last element is now in its proper position in sorted 
    order. Now, sort the remaining n-1 elements using the same step repeatedly. 
    When only one element is left, sorting is complete. This method is known as 
    selection sort
